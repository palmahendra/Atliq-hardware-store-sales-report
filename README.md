AtliQ Hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many clients such as Excel stores, and Surge stories across India. AtliQ Hardware's head office is situated in Delhi, India and they have many regional offices throughout India.

Problem statement:
Now Problem was that all these things happening were verbal and there was no proof with facts of how his business was affected which made him frustrated as he could see that overall sales were declining but when he asked the regional manager, he did not get a complete picture of his business. When he asks to give details, they give a lot of Excel files and this AtliQ hardware is big business so to see insight clearly, he needs a dashboard to look at real data. And he will get proper insight and can make data-driven decisions to increase sales of his company.
